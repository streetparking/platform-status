Version 1.73.72 debuts two new tools for admins and an email fix. Sometimes less is more.  


# What’s New
- Admins can now delete leads (for when you don’t need to remember the one that got away).
- Admins can also change emails in Membership Management. Feel the power. 


# Bug Fixes
- Emails weren’t going out to members after cancellation and, since communication is everything, we fixed it.
