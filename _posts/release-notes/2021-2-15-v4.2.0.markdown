Version 4.2.0 debuts Payment Page and Gift Card feature upgrades, as well as an array of bug fixes.

# What’s New
- The payment page needed a facelift, so we peeled things back and rearranged. Now, it’s looking younger, less tired and has a bit of a glow to it.
- Gift cards weren’t acting like gift cards at all, but now they’re doing that voodoo gift cards do so well (and apply as balance transactions rather than being weird).
- Speaking of gift cards, they’re now applicable to any kind of transaction (including promotions) and will no longer rudely boot off other discounts applied to the transaction.
- In the next iteration of Admin, users will be able to apply a coupon for a member: for those discount-y moments. 
- We updated Terms of Service to reflect a clearer cancellation policy. Even though TOS aren’t often actually read, they’re still important...kinda like release notes?
- We returned the new user reminder that it takes 24 hours to gain access to Members Only. If you know, you know. 
- We changed the ‘find something buggy” link to a ‘contact support’ email link on Sign Up, so SP Support no longer has to run all over computer land to access support tickets so they can save the running for workouts. 
- We popped the hood and tinkered around (and by tinkered, we mean were super intentional) preparing for an upcoming version wherein users can add multiple cards, assign a default and delete payment methods from the user profile.

# Bugs

- Previously, when an admin tried to create a coupon the modal (little pop up window) had an identity crisis and acted all shifty. It no longer does that. 

- The coupon/gift card field is now activated by a button. There was a whole bug thing with copy + paste and this is just way better. 

- We removed some potentially confusing mathematical symbols from the user activity history. 

- On change membership, there was a little bug where no default membership was selected. It felt a little incomplete, so we made a helpy default selection for the user. 

- Some users faced an error that stopped them from adding payments. We stopped the stoppage.

- We fixed a bug that could allow some users to use the same discount code multiple times, which should not be a thing, so it no longer is.

- Sometimes when a gift card was added, it created a super funky nonsensical/unsolvable math problem which is an issue because sensical math is confusing enough. It no longer does that. 

- Some returning users had shenanigans reactivating memberships. That’s over now like socks with sandals. 

- We fixed an internal server error by adding a more specific error that tells a user what the issue is and how to deal with it. Because if you’re gonna get an error, it’s better if it’s a little bossy instead of a lot ambiguous. 

- We fixed an issue that seemed to hold up users when trying to add a credit card. The card actually was added, but the user couldn’t see that and like...it’s not a puzzle, so we made things work properly. 

- We fixed a sticky button that, when changing a membership, would continuously select the lowest priced membership. It was like ‘I know what’s good for you’ and now it’s minding its business.
