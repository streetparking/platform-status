Version 6.78.0  

# Updates
- The program specific progress ring was counting based on available workouts, rather than considering the requirement, so now it gives credit for doing required things - which is much more satisfying (especially if I'm putting down my barbell for a month).

- Aaaand we updated some wording on the Badge info modal. (It was a little bit of a head scratcher as it was.)
