Version 6.60.0 debuts a challenge badge update and a scoring fix. 

# Features
- If a badge isn't active, it doesn't show up for users because if you can't see it, you can't ask about it, right? 

- We styled up the new Welcome Page a little more! 

<br/>

# Bug
- Max reps wasn't showing up correctly in the logbook and since the logbook's job is to show things correctly, we fixed it.
