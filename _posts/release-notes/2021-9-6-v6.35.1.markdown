Version 6.35.1 debuts score deletion capabilities and a fix to Challenges.

# Feature

- Users can now delete a score if they want to! For those workouts we'd just rather forget (and also if there was an entry error or something). 


# Bug

- We fixed a bug in Challenges that occurred when a user added scores, deleted all of their scores, and added them again - the Challenges infrastructure was like WUT!? and just kind of gave up. We gave it a pep talk and it shows accurate counts now.
