Version 6.52.0 debuts a media related bug fix. 

<br/>

# Features

- We spruced up the interface for admins while viewing collection details. 

- We zhughed (yep-that's how you spell it) up some buttons and styling on the Trophy Case, Sign Up, Forgot Password and Email Verification pages. 

- We made sure that all applicable media is showing up for customizations. Go figure. 


<br/>

# Bug
Scheduling a challenge no longer requires a start date. You do you, boo.
