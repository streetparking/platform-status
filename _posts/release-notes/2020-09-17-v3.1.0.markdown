Version 3.1.0 debuts an email improvement and a bug fix.

# Whatâ€™s New
- We changed the nature of the membership object and subsequently, the email query needed to get up to speed so it knew to look for the right things in order to send emails. Get the net.




# Bug Fixes

- There was a bug that may have made you feel like you were taking crazy pills because it showed the incorrect date on activity history when canceling a hold from admin. We fixed it.
