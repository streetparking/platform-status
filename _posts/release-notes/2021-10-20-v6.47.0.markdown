Version 6.47.0 debuts the end of scoring drafts and a media fix.  

# Features


- We did some styling so that when media has several associated tags, the tags don't take over the page and mess up the users view like jerks. 

- Drafts be gone! Closing the scoring sheet mid-score doesn't save a draft anymore. 

- We did even more coding voodoo that keeps scores and times zones playing nicely together.

# Bug

- A bug that was stoping media from updating correctly when a user changed dates and/or programs while viewing daily workouts and it felt a little bit like a matching game instead of workout information, so we fixed it.
