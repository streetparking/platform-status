Version 6.40.0 debuts two feature updates and two bug fixes. Even Steven...or Stephen.

# Features

- Users can now favorite and unfavorite a workout and view it under the favorites tab/ Gold stars all around. Except not, because that wouldn't be favorites then would it. 
- We spruced up the scoring emojis! Smile. Or Grimace...or have heart eyes. You choose. That's why they're there. 
- We added a 'replace media' button to media detail pages so that Admins can...replace media. Go figure. 


# Bugs
- We had a link to Extra Programs that didn't work on certain days of the week and no one asked for that, so we made it work err day.
- The arrows on the left and right of the media carousel used to point the same direction, like finger guns, but they're not finger guns, they're arrows, so we fixed.
