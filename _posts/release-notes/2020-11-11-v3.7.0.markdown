Version 3.7.0  debuts 


# What’s New
- We made it so the lowest priced membership pre-selects when multiple promos are running. You’re welcome, thrifty people. 
- If a user doesn’t qualify for a membership, it shows as disabled in the dropdown. So tidy. You’re welcome, easily confused people.
- We added payment summaries to the payment page when a coupon or promo has been applied. Show them the money
- We hooked up two new emails for when users request to cancel and request non-renewal. Miss you already.  
- We gave the user profile a little facelift and now users can change names and update social media information. It’s now fresh and slightly younger looking.
- Admins can now cancel a membership immediately or in the next cycle: both neatly packaged in a ‘danger zone’ so admins don’t just go cancelling users willy nilly.

<br/><br/>

# Bug Fixes
- We fixed a bug stopping admins from being able to delete leads. Admins can now delete all the leads, but don’t do that, just the delete-y ones.
<br/>

- We fixed a bug that was showing a $0.00 amount when a user tried to activate a membership. It was buggy and confusing, like i’m trying to come back; let me pay please.
<br/>

- The Reset Password button didn’t reset passwords, so that wasn’t great. But we fixed it and it’s now great (as far as resetting passwords goes).
