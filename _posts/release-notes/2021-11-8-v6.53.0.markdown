Version 6.53.0 debuts a welcome banner and landing page and a few bug fixes. 

<br/>

# Features

- We updated the Welcome Banner to reflect new member processes. Out with the old. 

- We added a cool new Welcome to My.Sp landing page so we can neatly inform users of all the things.


<br/>

# Bug
- We fixed a bug that was keeping up movement media from populating. It was in there, but it wasn't showing up. It was doing nothing. Which we are not about. So now it's behaving a bit better and doing more than nothing.

- Some workouts weren't favoriting properly and that was not our favorite, so we fixed it. 

- We re-wired up a media component so that thumbnails display correctly.
