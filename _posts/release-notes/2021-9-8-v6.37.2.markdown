Version 6.37.2 debuts a bug fix.   


# Bug

- If a Daily Workout had media that applied to all programs, and a user changed views between programs, the media would get stuck on the first program viewed (like when you wear too much clothing on a waterslide, for example). We fixed it though and now things are moving as they should be (like when you go down a waterslide with two other people and don't hit your head even once).
