Version 6.48.0 debuts a tagline description for Extra Programs and some search fixes. 

# Features
 
- Admins can now add captions to videos! 

- Extra Programs needed a brief description shown on the card so the description wouldn't hog up all the room on the card and look super extra. We added such a field and made the full description visible upon clicking into an Extra Program.

- We upgraded some cool nerdy tech stuff that makes things better for everyone.

# Bug

- When an admin used a search function, results didn't always populate in a very helpful way...which is the entire point of a search, really. So we fixed it. 

- Speaking of searches- if a search yielded a boat load of results, we added a button you can click to show the next 20.

- We fixed a bug that was duplicating notes notes on the daily workout. 

- A bug was bugging up the ability to save a Mamas Modification Note. (As if moms don't already have enough to deal with.) So we put the bug in time out and now things save as expected. -
