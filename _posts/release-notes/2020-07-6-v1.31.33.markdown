Version 1.31.33 debuts the member profile and admin portals which allow new users as well as admins to stay completely inside the Street Parking experience from the sign up process to membership management. This version also unveils bug fixes and feature upgrades that have taken the sign up experience from great to greater.

# What’s New
- New Manage Membership tools for both users and admins to give everyone more control  
- Fresh images from login to logout - good enough for the ‘gram #nofilter
- ID.me military and first responder employment verification now automatically calculate membership discounts on the Payment Page. Well deserved and handy!
- We brought admin processes together into one collection of apps to save users from running hither and yon to accomplish tasks. They’re listed below:  
    - Membership Management: We put member information into a one stop shop with time saving shortcuts. 
    - Coaching: Coaches can filter, view and access member information in one convenient place. 
    - Staff member information can now be managed in the Staff app - go figure. It also highlights which staff birthdays are coming up (so you can alert the party planning committee).
    - The Super Admin app lives up to its name by housing email templates, membership options and a super cool coupon creator.
    - Support Requests - We created this app as a hub for user support tickets rather than chasing them around inboxes. 
    

# Bug Fixes
- Who knew entering addresses could be such a shenanigan? Well we found out and fixed it up so you can now enter addresses without feeling like you’re being punked.  

- We changed some less-than-obvious-but-still-important font sizing and padding issues so the pages don’t feel like an eye exam. 

- We got rid of some typos that were too ridiculous to blame on autocorrect.

- We added confirmation messages for after you change your password or email. It just felt anticlimactic without them. 

- There was a glitch that unchecked the “I agree to Terms & Conditions” box if you scrolled back through the Terms & Conditions. We need that box to stay checked, so we fixed all that. 

- We corrected a discrepancy between what the Instagram handle field did and what the helper text suggested. It was a confusing “do as I do and not as I say” situation for those who pay close attention to helper text. 

- Securities for the admin apps got updated. Things were already safe, but are now even safer.

- If you were on mobile, the Profile menu would slide over and refuse collapse without rotating the screen from portrait to landscape and back. It has been fixed and is now appropriately collapsey.

- Social media query parameters have been improved so we can connect you to your social media handles with greater accuracy. Go ahead and @ us.
