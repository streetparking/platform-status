Version 6.8.0 debuts the fix of a bug.  


<br/>

# Bugs

- We found some sketchy bug that weirded up the wiring of users with a particular status (incomplete_expired if you want the deets). This basically gave users on all sides the run around and made it impossible to reactivate their accounts. And you know what they say about the run around...so we fixed it.
