Version 6.64.0 debuts an improved 'edit workout' flow and some improved counting. 

# Features
- Favorited workouts used to show a 'completed date' instead of a saved date, so now it shows when the user saved it which makes more sense.

- Returning members (welcome back, hey), are now routed to Manage Membership so things feel a little more helpy when getting re-situated.

- The Edit Score flow is now much smoother, gives clearer info and users will see the buttons change from "Log Workout" to "Edit Score" and won't be supes nervous that they're messing things up even though they weren't mostly.

- We extended the thing (a token) that makes you re-log-in to 30 days which should allow users to stay logged in longer.

# Bug
- The Trophy Case index (the tiled list of workouts you did to accomplish the challenge) was showing an extra checkmark which was very confusing and ain't nobody got time for that. (It's fixed now.)

- When a user edits a wodify score (why tho?), the dragon code that evaluates Challenges (counts and figures out all the things) was, in some cases, reevaluating when it didn't need to, This caused some Trophy Case confusion (which no one has time for, as discussed, so now it doesn't do that).
