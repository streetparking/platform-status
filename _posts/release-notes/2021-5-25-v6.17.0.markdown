Version 6.17.0 debuts a fix and a lil upgrade. 


# Feature

- The athlete search feature now runs twice as fast as it did. And you could too if you get cozy with the Endurance Program.


# Bug

- There was a weirdness moment with the ‘About Me’ form on Profile where the top Save button worked, but the bottom Save button didn’t and the Cancel button behaved questionably. The button makers fixed them though and all’s right with the world (as far as buttons are concerned).
