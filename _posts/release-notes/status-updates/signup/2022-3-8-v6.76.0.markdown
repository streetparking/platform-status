Version 6.76.0  

# Updates
- We think coupons should be like a good friend: reliable, doesn't lie to you and gets you discounts, but any coupons set to apply 'forever', were in fact, not sticking forever- making them unreliable lying liars offering no discounts. We fixed them though.

- The Trophy Case went through some spring cleaning and a remodel and we accidentally threw out the 75/365/1000 counters, but we dug through the trash, cleaned them off and returned them.

- The admin codes table now has both amount and percentage available for easier maths.

- Gift cards should always be balance transactions and some weren't behaving as such. They now behave (as such).
