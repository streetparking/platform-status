Version 6.77.0  

# Updates
- If a user experiences a delay upon hitting the 'Complete' button, a little spinning circle will show up that basically communicates, "Hey there, this button you just clicked/tapped is working, but it's taking a hot second, so hang in there. Oh and there's no need to click/tap it like 47 times or report that it's not working because it is and chances are you just have a shotty connection okay, so take a deep breath, great job on your workout, we're so proud of you, okay here's the next screen - thanks love you bye." (but concisely)

- The Trophy Case was recently updated (you may recall), but still needed a little zhuzhing, so we fixed some spacing on mobile, collapsed all of the new sections below 'In Progress', and a few other little style-y things that you might not notice now, but would if we left them.
