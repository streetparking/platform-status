Version 6.62.0 debuts a promo bug fix and a returning user re-classification. 

# Features
- When users who cancelled prior to the Wodify migration re-sign up, we now differentiate them as 'returning' rather than as leads (which is how they used to live in the system). 
- We upgraded the 'Watch This' video link. 
- When a mobile user clicks 'logout' they now see who their coach is. Why? That is a great question. 
<br/>

# Bug
- We squashed a little bug that was stopping some promos from showing as expected.
