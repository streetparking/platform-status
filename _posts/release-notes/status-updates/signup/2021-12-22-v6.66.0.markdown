Version 6.66.0

# Changes & Features
- Taxes are ready to be released on Jan 1. Merry Christmas, WA. 

- We added a loading wheel to challenge detail management in Admin so now you know we're thinking, not spacing out.

- We spruced up the user payment summary and line item display to reflect taxes as applicable.

- We added Special Program Counters - they count up and don't imply any specific goal, just more of a 'Hey, look! You did this many! Look at you go!"


<br/>

# Bug
- We fixed the scrolling on the date restrictions modal in admin challenge detail (modal = little pop up window).
- If an admin didn't set workout date ranges, they showed funkily for users. We unfunked it.
