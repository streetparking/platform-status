Version 6.67.0

# Changes
- Special Program workout counters didn't count a qualifying workout if it was done more than once. But now they do. 

- In Challenge details, admins now get a handy pop up window that asks them if they want to update or create.

<br/>

# Bug
- Bug fix alert: we fixed something techy that was bugging up the 'hey I have multiple gift cards on this transaction' process so that it works as expected.

- If an admin didn't set workout date ranges, they showed funkily for users. We unfunked it.
