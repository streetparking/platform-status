Version 6.26.3 debuts a fixed bug. 

# Bug

- When a postpartum gift card was purchased, the system gave it a gift card code (expected), but also gave it a coupon code (supes wrong) and if the coupon code was redeemed, it didn't do the gift card things (applying remaining balance for a user). As discussed, this was supes wrong, so we fixed it.
