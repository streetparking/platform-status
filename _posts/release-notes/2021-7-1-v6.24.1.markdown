Version 6.24.1 debuts two fixed bugs.


# Bugs

- What's in a name that a template by any other name would send as expected? A misnomer stopped the gift card emails from sending upon generation and unlike roses, templates by another name do not send (or smell) like they're supposed to. But it's fixed now.

- Cinderella story...outta nowhere...incomplete_expired users can now start a new membership (a bug created a snag in the ability to do that previously). So they got that going for 'em...which is nice.
