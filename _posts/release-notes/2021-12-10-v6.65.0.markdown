Version 6.65.0 debuts a 2:1 new stuff to bug fix ratio.

# Features
- Movement search ahead optimized We improved the search ahead situation for adding workouts to collections.

- We gave Jeb a break from smiling on the Sign Up page and now Julian is on there mixing up the facial expressions.

- We did some techy things and now Collections can be added to Challenges.

- We added a 'show count only' ability on a Challenge so it shows a count only instead of a 'hey you did this many out of this many' so people don't get crazy.

- If you type nonsense at end of url you will get to 404 page. Who knew that was even something we needed?

- We no longer truncate the short description of Collections so even if you get all wordy up in there, we won't play you off the stage.

# Bug
- Subtitles were not doing their thing on certain media, but now they're showing what you're saying as expected

- Workout Builder got glitchy and decided to do less than nothing (so not our thing), so we fixed it and now it works as expected.

- We removed Admin's edit score button (it wouldn't work correctly anyway and you know what they say...if it's broken, have it removed).
