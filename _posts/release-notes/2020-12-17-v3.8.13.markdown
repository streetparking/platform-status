Version 3.8.13 debuts a handful of hot fixes and the M-I-G-R-A-T-I-O-N!


# What’s New
- We removed backend tests that were no longer needed. (Testing is so hot these days.) 

- We implemented an email that will let a user know if their payment failed and provides convenient links to remedy it.

- We did a CRUD update for a new lead feature in Admin. (CRUD is a cute acronym for create, read, update and delete, that helps with user data storage.) There’s a lot more CRUD management going on than you usually hear about, but who doesn’t love a little CRUD now and then. Am I right?
