Version 6.69.3  


<br/>

# Bug
- If a user was clicking around the calendar willy-nilly (as one does), a bug caused the calendar to think it was a day in the future and, if no release date was set for the workout, it was displayed. We fixed it so that no matter of wacky clicking will show anything that shouldn't be seen.
