Version 6.46.2 debuts three feature upgrades and one styling change. 

# Features

- Okay, turns out that even though no one liked the draft button, they kinda liked their score saving if it was only partially done. SO, now if a user closes the scoring sheet mid-score, the score automatically saves...as a draft, but there's still no draft button, so everyone wins. 
- The Logbook now lists the workout title first which is also a handy dandy link that opens to the workout! 
- The Heathers Like This post scoring pop up now links to the Trophy Case instead of the Logbook, because we want to see those counts, amiright? 
- There was a lot of extra space just floating around when Coach Admins added an note to a workout, so now it's much more streamlined and chic.
