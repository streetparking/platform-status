Version 3.7.2  has been rolled back to 3.7.0 due to a bug.  
<br/><br/>
Dev Team: Do not roll back to 3.7.2.


# What’s New
- Admins can now specify which member group(s) (new, returning, or current users) can apply coupons to specific memberships (or in general). It’s kind of like when Glen Coco got 4 candy canes, Cady Heron got 1 and none for Gretchen Weiners, bye. 


# Bug Fixes
- Nothing to see here.
