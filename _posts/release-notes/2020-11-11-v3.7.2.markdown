Version 3.7.2  debuts the ability to apply coupons to specific member groups.
<br/><br/>


# What’s New
- Member groups are now part of coupon codes so admins can specify if a particular group or groups (new, returning and/or current users) can apply coupons to specific memberships (or in general). It’s kind of like when Glen Coco got 4 candy canes, Cady Heron got 1 and none for Gretchen Weiners, bye. 


# Bug Fixes
- Nothing to see here.
