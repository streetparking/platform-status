Version 3.8.10 debuts behind the scenes updates, migration preparations and a couple new email implementations. 


# What’s New
- We made some redis queue updates, which is a way of organizing things that need to happen in a super smarty way. 

- We also added some layers of testing that will help ensure all the gears and cogs that run things are moving smoothly...because that’s how computers work. #technology. 

- We added a membership init card which is a thing to help with post migration processing. 

- We implemented emails on the admin side that will encourage the incomplete expired and incomplete homies that didn’t quite finish signing up to come back, sign up and make all the gains.
