Version 6.38.0 debuts a media addition, Maintenance Buttons and release dates on the Workout Builder.    

# Features

- Coach Admins can now add a date and time to release a workout via the Workout Builder. Say when. ::doc holiday voice:: https://youtu.be/j5kokM0M45Y
- If a Coach Admin adds Maintenance to a Daily Workout, a button will now show up for the user that brings up Maintenance videos just right...because that's what developers do: they make buttons (but for real, how do you think buttons get places?! Someone has to make them). 
- We made it so that Coach Admins can add more than one piece of media to a movement in the Movement Library. That's how media comes right? In pieces?
