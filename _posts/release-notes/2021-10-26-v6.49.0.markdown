Version 6.49.0 debuts strict challenges and a bug fix. 

# Features
 
- We spruced up some alignment and added some more explicit wording in the Logbook. (Explicit as in 'clear', not like swear words and stuff.)

- We also spruced up some spacing on user fitness views, workout notes and logbooks. 

- We added a 'call to action' space for admins to display helpful info on Extra Programs. Helpy. 

- Challenges now have the option to be 'strict' or ... not strict (relaxed?). If a challenge is toggled to strict, the workouts must be completed in real time and cannot be scored outside of specified timeframes (we're looking at you, Vault). 

- Oh and users can now see their membership status when viewing the platform on mobile.

# Bug

- We fixed a bug that wasn't allowing verbatim search results, which kind of feels ironic, right?
