Version 2.2.5 debuts enhancements to the backend - making already speedy things even speedier.


# What’s New
- Faster than a speeding bullet - it’s our backend server again casually cruising along at mach 20 as it checks logs for data sources for maximum efficiency. 
- Testing is so hot these days. We initiated some new server tests to keep things spicy and well-functioning.




# Bug Fixes
- This is a bug-free zone.
