Version 6.23.0 debuts one new feature and one bug. Even Steven. 


# Feature

- We added a tags table for Admins so they can now can search tags that are currently in system - think hashtags - it's an identifier and can help sort and group things together. Just like you can search #beyonce and see all things Queen B - well on this table you can search for 'kettlebells' and see all things...well, kettlebells. 

# Bug

- FACT. When a change is made, the user activity history should auto-refresh. But it didn't (FALSE) and that's why we fixed it.
