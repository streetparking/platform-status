Version 6.69.0  

# Features
- We added a double confirm on the amount credited in a balance transaction. Are you sure? Like...are you SURE SURE? Okay, you may procede. 
- When a user changes their membership, they can now see their current credit card being charged. It just feels good to know. 
- We hid the 'sleep' icon on Admin, as they're no longer putting members to sleep. That sounds weird.

# Bug
- Confession: we forgot to add pagination for Favorite workouts, so if a user has more than 20 favorite workouts (how already though?) they could see 20 and then the rest just seemed to float around somewhere unaccessible in computer land. So we added it. Gosh it felt so good to say it out loud.
