Version 6.33.0 debuts debuts a cosmetic procedure and a couple of emails. 

# Feature

- We wired up birthday and anniversary emails so that members hear from us on special days. For example, when it's someone's birthday...you know what, I feel like this one requires no explanation.


# Bugs

- We gave the media player carousel buttons a little facelift so they work in a comfier way (you can play, pause, stop, without other buttons getting in the way - you know...video things) and have a youthful glow.
- Also, if you swipe right on a video, it pauses instead of trying to keep showing the media. Just like Tinder. 
- Alerts didn't obey the little 'x' in the corner to close them. They work now. yay.
