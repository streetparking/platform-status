Version 3.8.21 debuts a payment update upgrade. 


# What’s New
- We connected the dots between my.streetparking.com and Stripe’s new feature wherein a default payment method can be set when multiple payment methods are present. Users won’t experience this directly, but their billing situation will be much more sensical.
