Version 6.58.0 debuts two upgrades and a bug fix.

# Features
- We added a little "hey there new members, Start Here" link that directs newbies to the on ramp info, but it's just called "Start Here" because the rest of that stuff wouldn't fit.

- Users can now edit a score by clicking on the table from Logbook. What? OMG so convenient.

<br/>

# Bug
- When an Admin overrides or reconciles a user's challenges, we make sure that counts are responding as expected, because they weren't for a minute.
