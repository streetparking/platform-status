Version 6.36.0 debuts a styling update and a re-addition to the Workout Builder.  

# Feature

- We created a place for videos that applied to all workouts. And then we removed it. And now it's back like the third installment of a movie trilogy that is actually great instead of garbage like most are. I'm looking at you Home Alone 3. 

# Bugs

- The Trophy Case in User Fitness got some chic new styling. ::tosses hair::
- If a user favorited a Collection, all of the media in the Collection was trying to show at the same time on the favorite Collection page and it was hot-mess-esque, so now just logo shows and all is well.
