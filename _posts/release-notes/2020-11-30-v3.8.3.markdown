Version 3.8.3 debuts two bug fixes allowing members to switch promotional memberships and use the entirety of their gift cards. 

<br/>

# Bug Fixes
- A silly bug tried to stop active users from changing from one promotional membership to another and we didnâ€™t think it was funny, so we fixed it.

- An API shenanigan caused gift card surpluses to completely disappear and be lost forever, not like disappearing ink that reappears when you breathe on it or something- it was actually gone and unusable by the user. We un-disappeared them and now gift card surpluses behave as expected.
