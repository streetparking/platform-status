Version 6.57.0 debuts four little upgrades!

# Features
- Everyone loves a little validation so we added a 'success' message to confirm that an Admin has successfully removed a security role from a member. 

- We made badges clickable for flexibility of badge usage. 

- We added a 'today' button on on daily workouts for those users who deep dive into workouts from 19 years ago who want to return to the present with one click. 

- We updated the way the trophy case counts edited Wodify workouts because, well we needed to.
