Version 3.8.15 debuts some hot fixes and a temporary adjustment to the user profile. 



# What’s New
- We temporarily removed the ability for users to change memberships while migration completes. No change for you!!

# Bugs

- There was an issue where some emails were being triggered so fast that the system couldn’t see they were created so it decided to send another one. It’s your basic overachieving system situation and we fixed it. 

- Some users experienced a bit of a head scratcher making changes to their migrated addresses so we transferred the state and country fields so they hit in a bit more of an expected way.
