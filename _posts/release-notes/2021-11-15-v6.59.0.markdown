Version 6.59.0 debuts an Issues and Feedback link and a fixed bug. 

# Features
- We added a convenient little link to an Issues and Feedback from at the bottom of the page so we can get all the feedback. Bring it on. 


<br/>

# Bug
- There was a bug that caused the score to disappear if the user chose an emoji after entering the score, but we fixed it because that's just nonsense.
