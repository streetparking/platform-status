Version 3.4.0 debuts a user notification update, text and formatting changes as well as some performance boosters. 

# What’s New
- When bulk emails are sent out, the notification table for each individual user is updated. So it’s not just one bulk “hey this was sent” kinda vibe and more of a “You’ve got mail!” kinda vibe. 
- We added a performance enhancement that essentially cuts out the middleman between users and servers and makes things totes fast. (And super important for handling loads of members.) 
- We removed the bold formatting on the email verification page, because calm down, it’s just a verification page - no need for any bold sass-text. 
- We added the shopify-coupon-id to the link sent in the SP Mama’s email. It’s now a simple click and go situation. Easy peasy - just like parenthood. 
- We updated some language on the payment page so it’s a little smoother and made some helper text even helpier.  
- We added a cute little 🌙  “sleep”  button on the social media table. It’s less about beauty rest and more about allowing Admins to set a "sleep" timer on a member pending an ADD or REMOVE from social media platforms.
