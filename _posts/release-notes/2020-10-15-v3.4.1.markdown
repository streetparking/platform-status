Version 3.4.1 debuts a new email trigger, an email updat, and a couple of fixed bugs. 

# What’s New
- We created a new feature for emails that uses a pattern to trigger emails. It’s simple and efficient and super duper needed. And if you buy two right now, you get a third one for only the cost of shipping. 
- We updated user notifications to take message queues from other services. Basically it’s a techy thing where two different server apps can talk to each other and it’s important in email land. 

# Bug Fixes
- We fixed a confusion in membership activity that displayed pending holds rather than just current holds. Let’s just be present and not mix things up with upcoming holds, mmmkay?
- There was a bug that was erroneously sending suspensions to Wodify if a membership was trialing in the new application. We fixed it and now the suspensions are suspended...expelled really.
