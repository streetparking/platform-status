Version 6.13.0 debuts darn near 10 new featuers and a few fixed bugs. 


# New Features

- We all know it’s important to stay relevant. In related news, users and Admins can now update user goals. 
- We firmed up our password security and now users can’t create a password that includes only spaces. Sorry to everyone with those ghosty passwords, you gotta use more than the ol’ spacebar to lock it up. 
- We tidied up some code so it’s cleaner and prettier and easier to update. 
- We wired up the Coach Checkin and Welcome Back emails so new and returning users feel even more loved. #devteamlikesthis
- We spruced up a few little copy moments a user gets when they sign in. 
- Not to brag or anything, but now Admins can see a user’s membership status on any page. 
- We added “coming soon” to pages that are coming soon. Revolutionary. 
- We created the community tab on Admin with some extra capabilities that turned out to be unnecessary so we 86’d that ish.
- Admins can now search by any part of a name when searching for a user. If you want to find John Smith, you don’t have to search by his embarrassing email address johnfartsforfun@gmail.com You can just search for John, Smith or farts and find who you’re looking for.

# Bugs

- There was a bug inhibiting a gift card from applying properly to pending cancelations. The bug is squashed and now gift cards apply uninhibited and free.

- Sometimes when a user tried to change their password they got the wrong error. And let’s be real, it’s hard enough to remember what you just changed your password to without getting derailed by an ironically incorrect error. It’s fixed now though. 

- If you know anything about emails, you probably know that sometimes they send at all the wrong times. It turns out we had such an email (the nerve) and now it sends at the right time.
