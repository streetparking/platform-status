Version 6.70.0  

# Features
- We love the smell of fresh copy in the morning, so we updated the Welcome Page as requested. 

- We added the option to add a payment method on the manage membership dropdown menu and now manage membership thinks it's all fancy. 

- We removed the option to change membership for Past Due users because things were getting hairy (and to keep manage membership humble). 

- We changed About Me to My Account because people didn't need to find themselves, they needed to find where to update their payment info. 

- We hide workouts on the Trophy Case detail if they're not released because it's a secret. 

- We used to call badge-related things Challenges because that's how it's viewed from code-land, but Challenges means a lot of things, so we changed Challenges to Trophies and now we all get it.

# Bug
- Challenge Creation got an upgrade! You can create a challenge that counts for days or workouts, define minimum workouts and now challenges can be program specific (this was a thing before, but now it's even more of a thing, so I'm telling you ICYMI.

- We fixed the broken On Ramp link on the side menu. And you know what they say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix itâ€¦but this was broken so we did what we had to do.
