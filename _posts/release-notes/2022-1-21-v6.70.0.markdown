Version 6.70.0  

# Features
- Challenge Creation got an upgrade! You can create a challenge that counts for days or workouts, define minimum workouts and now challenges can be program specific
- Adding a program to a challenge is now on the challenge detail page. It's all in the details, as they say. 
- Admins can now add programs to a challenge - the gifts just keep coming!
- Breadcrumbs have been added to pages. Breadcrumbs are a known hot mess in coding land, so next time you casually brush aside a breadcrumb, remember that somwhere, a developer is triggered to twitching at the mere though of them.

# Bug
- We smashed a bug that wasn't showing the created date for user scores.
