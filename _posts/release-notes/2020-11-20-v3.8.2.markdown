Version 3.8.2 debuts dollar amount gift cards, pre-loaded promotions for user groups and three bug fixes. 

<br/><br/>


# What’s New
- We made it so that promotions now pre-load as applicable for current and re-activating users. Straight up luxury.

- Gift cards made the big jump from memberships to dollar amounts and we are very proud of them. Our little cards are growing up. 

<br/>

# Bug Fixes
- Once in a while users, a bug allowed multiple invoices to be created for one subscription. We fixed it because one subscription for the price of two isn’t a cute look. 

- A bug was showing users all promos instead of the ones specifically applicable to their user group. Promos now display accurately and order has been restored to the force. 

- We did a thing to help SP Mamas not have to type in a coupon code for the 4th Trimester Bundle and accidentally ended up removing the code all together. Mamas bring life into the world, the least we can do is make sure the code works, so it’s back.
