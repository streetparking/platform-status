Version 6.61.0 debuts two little updates. 

# Features
- We updated the Welcome page and fixed a few weak links and made more mobile responsive, because it's a web APP, not just a website, people. 

- When a user scores, The Heathers Like This page now gives the option to navigate to the Trophy Case or the Logbook. Cute and functional.
