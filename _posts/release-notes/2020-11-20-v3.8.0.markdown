Version 3.8.0  debuts the ability to apply coupons to specific member groups, update emails including a help for new SP Mamas and a handful of demolished bugs. 
<br/><br/>


# What’s New
- Member groups are now part of coupon codes so admins can specify if a particular group or groups (new users, returning users, current users) can apply coupons to specific memberships (or in general). It’s kind of like when Glen Coco got 4 candy canes, Cady Heron got 1 and none for Gretchen Weiners, bye. 

- New moms have enough going without having to worry about messing with a case-wild-alpha-numeric coupon code, so we made it so the code automatically fills in the coupon field when a new SP Mama completes the Sign Up process. 

- We added the Membership Incomplete_Expired email and migrated the Welcome Email to the new queue process (which is a much cleaner, more efficient email service and it’s high key nerdily exciting). 

- Our backend engineer worked some voodoo (gnar gnar smart, efficient, system awesomeness) and prepped the system for migrating thousands of users.
