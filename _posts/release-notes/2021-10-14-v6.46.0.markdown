Version 6.46.0 debuts one bug fix and some scoring upgrades!

# Features

- Scoring is now on one convenient page instead of a stepper. Wham bam. 
- We made videos automatically pause when a user leaves the app instead of continuing to play in some awkward kinda way. 
-  We added time pickers instead of date pickers for when Admins want to create a challenge at just the right moment. 
- We added an extra challenge box users can check if they did the extra challenge in a workout, but we kept it subtle so that people aren't tempted to feel too fancy if they do it or lame sauce if they don't because that's not what we are about! ::begins slow clap::
- The answer to the age old question of "If you score a workout and don't select an emoji, did you even workout?" is yes. Users are no longer required to select an emoji to log a workout. If an emoji is not selected, a box that says "I worked out" shows up so users can keep it super simple.

# Bug
- It used to be that an end date could be set before a start date which, unless you have a time machine, didn't make sense, but you can put away your flux capacitor because we fixed it.
